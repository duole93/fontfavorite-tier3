# Font-favorite-tier3

- A Google Fonts clone using React, Node, and Express.
- Chingu.io Explorer Web Application Project

# Functionality

- and that is for now ðŸ˜…

# Download/Fork 

`git clone https://github.com/duole93/fontfavorite-tier3.git`

# Install

### STEP 1: Install node modules dependancies

- There are 2 folders, `client` and `server`.
- `cd` to each folder and install node modules dependancies

```
cd client
npm install
```
```
cd server
npm install
``` 

### STEP 2: Get Google Font API key from [Google Developer Font API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api)

### STEP 3: Set up `localhost` port and add `Google font API key` to server side

- because react-app by default using port `3000` we need a different port for our server
- in order to do that, create `.env` file at the root level of server folder (i.e server/.env)

```
PORT=5000
REACT_APP_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
** NOTE: if you want to use different port, make sure to change the `proxy` of package.json in `client` folder to the port number of your choice. 


### STEP 4: Start the project

-In terminal, nevigate to `server` folder and run the command

`node server.js`

-In terminal, nevigate to client folder and run the command

`npm start`
